# AI Domain Skills

Skills related to AI/ML systems, agent architectures, models, and tool integrations.

## When to Load This Domain

Load when working on:
- Designing or implementing AI agents
- Selecting or configuring LLMs
- Integrating external tools and services with agents
- Understanding agent-specific patterns and architectures

## Skills in This Domain

### Agents

#### agents/letta/
- **letta-agent-designer** - Designing effective Letta agents (architecture, memory blocks, models, tools)
- **letta-memory-architect** - Memory architecture design for Letta agents (block structure, memory types, concurrency)

### Models
*No skills yet - potential for model selection, prompting patterns, context optimization*

### Tools
- **tools/mcp-builder** - Creating MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to integrate external APIs and services

## Domain Coverage

**Current focus:**
- Letta-specific agent design patterns
- Memory architecture for stateful agents
- MCP server integration patterns

**Future expansion potential:**
- General agent design patterns (cross-platform)
- Model selection and configuration guides
- Prompt engineering patterns
- Context window optimization
- Multi-agent coordination
